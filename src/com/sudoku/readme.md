Welcome!
This is my first Java project ever, so the code might be bad.

At least, this is a 4x4 grid sudoku generator. A task i got from HiQ.
Simply it goes through several algorithms to create a fully solved sudoku, then removes random coordinates and replace them with 0s. Then it prints the full board out.
You can change the difficulty of the "game" by changing the value/int named "delNumber" in Main.java. It's easy to see and is currently on row 19.
If you enter "7" in delNumber as an example, it will remove 7 numbers and change them to zeros. That gives you 7 numbers to solve out.

There is no need to build, or test it really. Just add the code into a compiler, read the comments and run it. (Do not forget to change difficulty by changing delNumber)
